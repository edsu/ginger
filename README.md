ginger
======

Ginger is a set of programs for harvesting large sets of URLs in a distributed 
fashion using Amazon Web Services. Think of ginger as Web harvesting rebooted 
for the cloud, so that you can reasonably rent the machines when you need them,
and can retire them when you don't. If you are wondering why "ginger" let's 
just say it's because @eikeon likes golang, AWS, the Web ... and ginger. We
think you will too.
